## Technical Details

### Orbital Mechanics
The disk rotation incorporates realistic orbital mechanics:
```python
orbital_frequency = sqrt(1.0 / r³)  # Kepler's law approximation
```

### Enhanced Intersection Logic
The 3D intersection calculation considers:
- Ray geometry and disk thickness
- Warping factors based on azimuthal position
- Probabilistic hit detection for realistic rendering

### Relativistic Calculations
- Proper relativistic Doppler factor: `sqrt((1-β)/(1+β))`
- Beaming factor: `1/((1 + β·α)³)`
- Gravitational redshift: `sqrt(1 - rs/r)`

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
The enhanced system works with existing controls:
```python
# Standard camera and disk controls remain the same
# New controls:
# F/V: Adjust rotation speed (0.0 = static, 1.0 = maximum)
# C/B: Rotate the disk azimuthally
```

### Parameter Ranges
- `disk_rotation_speed`: 0.0 (static) to 1.0 (fast rotation)
- `disk_azimuthal_angle`: Any radian value (continuous rotation)

## Performance Characteristics
